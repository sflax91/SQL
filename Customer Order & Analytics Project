#Project completed in SQLiteStudio, using BIT_DB database downloaded from here:
#https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvsasmtr8syq2c2/BIT_DB?dl=0 as part of Break Into Tech online course

#Database contains six tables: JanSales, FebSales, MarSales, AprSales, MaySales, and customers.
#customers table contains two attributes: order_id and acctnum
#check data types on order_id and acctnum:
  PRAGMA table_info(customers)
  
#order_id is varchar(8) and acctnum is varchar(10)

#repeat process for other tables, confirm that types make sense for the info in the attributes (ex: datetime is the datatype for the orderdate atribute)

#First question: How many orders were placed in January?
#Before we begin, we need to check for clean data. A quick look (SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales) at our JanSales table, sorted by orderID ASC and DESC (by double clicking orderID column in results), shows that majority of orderIDs are 6-digit numbers, but others have the text "Order ID" and others are blank. We'll want to filter these out by attaching
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
to our queries.

#Next, I want to check for duplicates. Duplicates might give us an incorrect number when searching for total orders placed in January. Using the following query:
SELECT 
    orderID,
    product,
    location,
    quantity,
    orderdate,
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY
    orderID,
    product,
    location,
    quantity,
    orderdate
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

#I found 10 instances where a row was repeated: same exact order time, quantity, product, etc. Running an abridged version of the above query (only selecting OrderID), I can see that OrderIDs can be repeated, but often have different products for the same order. And we know that more than 1 quantity of an item can be purchased (SELECT DISTINCT(quantity)FROM BIT_DB.JanSales). So, it would be fair to assume that these initial duplicates are errors, since instead of ordering the exact same item twice, one could order a quantity of 2. But, without understanding how these items were ordered (online shopping?), we can't immediately exclude these duplicates since we're not absolutely sure they're errors.

#All that being said, the query
  SELECT
  Count(*)
  FROM
  BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
#gives us the answer of 9,681 orders in January

## Second question: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
