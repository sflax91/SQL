#As part of the Break Into Tech certificate course, I downloaded data from Kaggle on the top 50 spotify songs from 2021.
#Dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?resource=download
#More information, including descriptions of column names, can be found at the link above. 
#I first created a table, then inserted the downloaded data into that table.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then, I came up with my own questions, which I answered using SQL:
#1. What artists had the most songs in the top 50?
#2. Which artists has the highest average popularity?
#3. What are the top 5 most "danceable" songs?
